### About me

In 2018 I made a bold decision to change my career and leap into the world of computer progamming.  Having worked in Company Secretarial industry for nearly 12 years, it became apparent to me how tech was changing the future and suffering from FOMO (fear of missing out), I decided I want to be apart of the change.  I then applied to Makers Academy (an intensive 12 week coding bootcamp) and having recently graduated from the course, I am looking to start a new adventure as a junior developer role with a great company.
