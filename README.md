### About me

In 2018 I made a bold decision to change my career and leap into the world of computer progamming.  Having worked in the Company Secretarial industry for nearly 12 years, it became impossible to ignore how much tech was changing the future and suffering from FOMO (fear of missing out), I knew I had to be a contributor.  I applied to Makers Academy (a highly selective, intensive 12 week coding bootcamp) and having recently graduated from the course, I am now looking to launch my new career as a fully fledged full-stack junior developer, with an eagerness and drive to learn, with a great company.

## Projects && Code

The Makers Academy curriculum is centred around learning to code by doing. The projects focus on Agile best practices like TDD and pair programming - modeling the modern world of software engineering in the workplace.  You can see my progression throughout the course on my Github however, below are some select projects to demonstrate what I have learnt in just 13 weeks:

| Project | Description | Construction time | Technologies Used | Testing Frameworks |
| :---    |     :---    |              ---: |        :---:      |               ---: |
| Fishnet | Four individuals were given the task of creating our interpretation of Facebook with an emphasis on focusing on learning as a group. There is no real expanation for the name.     | 2 weeks   | Ruby on Rails AWS Bootstrap| Rspec Capybara Travis |
| Bank Tech Test | git diff       | git diff      |
| Make My Day | 

## Skills

#### Team Work

For my first group project (recreating our rendition of AirBNB), we decided that the purpose of the week was to learn and to try to use new technologies. Morale fluctuated as we underestimated how difficult it would be to wrestle with these tech stacks. Running daily standups and retros, I ensured that our group kept our eyes on the objective we set when we started â€” our moods always better coming out of them than going in. I believe this helped us to keep focus of what we wanted out of the project whilst maintaining good group cohesion. Ultimately, at the end of the project, we came out deciding that we did learn - hitting our objective.

#### Ability to work under preassure 

Clean code advocate
Makers shaped and facilitated my want to be a purveyor of clean code. Exercising programming principles such as SOLID and DRY, practicing usage of XP Values in group situations to ensure we were on the same wavelength, striking a fine balance between having an efficient and a readable codebase (for yourself as well as for others!) and using TDD/BDD to keep pesky bugs out of the way when that crafted code is pushed to production.

I truly believe in this approach to programming and coding and hope to work with others that respect it as much as I do.
