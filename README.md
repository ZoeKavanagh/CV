### About me

In 2018 I made a bold decision to change my career and leap into the world of computer progamming.  Having worked in the Company Secretarial industry for nearly 12 years, it became impossible to ignore how much tech was changing the future and suffering from FOMO (fear of missing out), I knew I had to be a contributor.  I applied to Makers Academy (a highly selective, intensive 12 week coding bootcamp) and having recently graduated from the course, I am now looking to launch my new career as a fully fledged full-stack junior developer, with an eagerness and drive to learn, with a great company.

## Projects && Code

The Makers Academy curriculum is centred around learning to code by doing. The projects focus on Agile best practices like TDD and pair programming - modeling the modern world of software engineering in the workplace.  You can see my progression throughout the course on my Github however, below are some select projects to demonstrate what I have learnt in just 13 weeks:

| Project      | Description | Construction time | Technologies Used | Testing Frameworks |
| :---         |     :---    |              ---: |:---               |               ---: |
| [Fishnet](https://github.com/ZoeKavanagh/fishnet "Fishnet Repo")    | Four individuals were given the task of creating our interpretation of Facebook with an emphasis on focusing on learning as a group. There is no real expanation for the name.   | 2 weeks   | Ruby on Rails, AWS, Bootstrap, Postgres | Rspec, Capybara, Travis |
| [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/ZoeKavanagh/bank_tech_test "Bank Tech Test Repo")    | An individual attempt a real life tech test.   | 2-3 days  | Ruby | Rspec |
| [Make My Day](https://polar-beach-63507.herokuapp.com "Make My Day Deployed")     | Our final project was to create a fun new app that uses an API (which we built ourselves) to display fun suggestions for the user to do on a selected date. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, React, HTML, CSS, Heroku, Travis, AWS3, Postgres | Rspec, Capybara |

## Skills

#### Team Work

I have now worked on four group projects through out my time at Makers, and although working as a team can be challenging, it definitely 

#### Ability to work under preassure 

Clean code advocate
Makers shaped and facilitated my want to be a purveyor of clean code. Exercising programming principles such as SOLID and DRY, practicing usage of XP Values in group situations to ensure we were on the same wavelength, striking a fine balance between having an efficient and a readable codebase (for yourself as well as for others!) and using TDD/BDD to keep pesky bugs out of the way when that crafted code is pushed to production.

I truly believe in this approach to programming and coding and hope to work with others that respect it as much as I do.
