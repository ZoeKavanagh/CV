### A bit about me

I made a decision in 2018 to change my career and leap into the world of tech.  Having worked in Company Secretarial for 11 years, I could see clearly how tech would change the future of the secretarial industry entirely which provoked me to consider the future and my role in contributing the future.  I decided to apply to Makers Academy (12 week coding bootcamp) and having graduated from the course, I am looking for junior developer role with a great company.
